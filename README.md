## üß† WordleSolver

This is a small group project done together with the **amazing [Leo](https://github.com/llaakson)**.

It was a quick 2-day assignment we completed at **Hive Helsinki** (the coding school).

The topic is **Wordle** ‚Äì yes, as in the New York Times! You can test several different programs related to the game:

### üß© What's included

1. **Solver program** ‚Äì well, actually, quite a few:
   - **Website versions:**
     - One that offers a full list of available guesses
     - One that provides a single guess that matches the criteria
   - **Terminal version:**
     - Takes input from the user in the command line and returns guesses that still match

2. **Auto-solver**  
   A small program that first picks a random word and then tries to guess it on its own.

3. **Playable Wordle game**  
   A terminal-based version of the game you can play yourself.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

To run the programs, you'll need:

- üêç **Python**  
  Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and **make sure to add Python to PATH** during setup.

- üå∂Ô∏è **Flask**  
  Install via pip:
  ```pip install Flask```

Later on just run the chosen app, by typing  ```python3 [programName.py]``` for example:

```python3 worlde.py``` - for the solving assistance with a list (website)

```python3 worlde_auto.py``` - for the solving assistance with one option only (website)

```python3 auto_solver.py``` - for the program that plays the game on its own (website)

```python3 terminalGame.py``` - for the terminal Wordle game

If you decide to test a program that's using a website, you need to copy the IP address from your terminal and paste it in a web browser of your choice. It will only be available locally.

### üîë Takeaways 

For both of us it was a first closer meeting with Python. 

We are pretty happy with the results but we'd welcome any constructive feedback and improvement suggestions.

The website is simple HTML, because we hope to include it in our web server project.

Hope you have as much fun playing as we had making it!
